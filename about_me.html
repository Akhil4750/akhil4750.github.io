						<h1>About Me</h1>
					</header>

					<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<p>Welcome to my professional space! I'm Akhil Varma Tirumalaraju, a passionate and driven
						individual with a strong foundation in both Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. My
						journey from the small town of Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, to pursuing advanced studies and
						working on impactful projects across various domains, has shaped me into the versatile
						professional I am today.</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>My Journey</h2>
					<p>I began my academic journey in Vizianagaram, where I completed my schooling. My curiosity and
						drive led me to Aditya Engineering College (AEC) in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, where I pursued a
						Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. My dedication to academic excellence earned me a
						spot in the top ranks throughout my undergraduate studies, culminating in a distinction upon
						graduation.</p>
					<p>During my time at AEC, I actively engaged in both professional and community service
						organizations. I was a member of the Student - Indian Society of Mechanical Engineering
						(Stud.ISME) and the Society of Automotive Engineering. One of the highlights of my undergraduate
						years was participating in a student Formula car competition, where I collaborated with a team
						of 16 to design, fabricate, and race our vehicle, securing second place. My role in the design
						and sourcing team was pivotal to our success.</p>
					<p>I also served as a board member, Treasurer, and Advisor in the Aditya LEO Club, where I led
						various community service initiatives, including blood donation camps, fundraising events, and
						remodeling primary schools. These experiences not only honed my leadership and organizational
						skills but also instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility toward societal well-being.</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
					<p>After graduation, I joined Wipro in Bangalore, where I worked on two major projects as detailed
						in my resume. Despite being new to the IT field, I quickly adapted to the demands of software
						development, mastering coding and various development tools. The experience at Wipro, guided by
						its core values, equipped me with essential professional skills and a strong understanding of
						corporate dynamics.
					</p>
					<p>
						My time at Wipro fueled my desire to deepen my knowledge in Computer Science, leading me to
						pursue a Master's degree in the field. The challenges and opportunities I encountered during
						this phase of my life further solidified my confidence and passion for technology.
					</p>


					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Life in the United States</h2>
					<p>Moving to the United States for my Master's at the University of Bridgeport was a transformative
						experience. The diverse and dynamic environment here pushed me to explore new avenues and
						discover my full potential. One of the most rewarding experiences was emceeing the International
						Festival, which had an audience of over 350 students, and leading orientations for international
						students every semester. My involvement in these activities earned me the Graduate Assistantship
						in the Center for Student Involvement.
					</p>
					<p>My commitment to thinking outside the box and taking on additional responsibilities led to being
						named Graduate Assistant of the Year. Furthermore, my significant impact on the university
						community was recognized with the Shining Knights Spirit Award at the Student Leadership Awards.
					</p>

					<h2>Transferable Qualities</h2>
					<p>Throughout my journey, several key qualities have consistently driven my success:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Transitioning from Mechanical Engineering to Computer
							Science, and excelling in both, demonstrates my ability to quickly learn and apply new
							skills in diverse fields.</li>
						<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> My roles in various student organizations and professional
							projects have equipped me with strong leadership and team collaboration skills.</li>
						<li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Whether it was designing a Formula car or developing
							software solutions, my ability to analyze complex problems and implement effective solutions
							has been a cornerstone of my work.</li>
						<li><strong>Communication:</strong> My experience as an emcee and orientation leader showcases
							my ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences, a skill crucial in any
							professional setting.</li>
						<li><strong>Community Focus:</strong> My involvement in community service through the Aditya LEO
							Club reflects my commitment to making a positive impact beyond my professional endeavors.
						</li>
					</ul>
